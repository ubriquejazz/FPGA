README.TXT for HAMMERHEAD Single PCI (SPCI) TRANSFERS
=====================================================

Notes:
1.  The file FIN_PCI_HH.DLB is needed for this example.  This is a library of 
PCI transfer routines provided by Bittware.  The location of this file is:
d:\<yourpath>\examples\libs - where d: is your hard drive designator, and 
<yourpath> is the directory path where you have installed your examples.

2.  Although FIN_PCI_HH.DLB is local to the other source files for this example, 
it is recommended that when adding of this file to the project, point to a central 
location, as described in Note 1.  This way, one instance of the library can be 
pointed to by multiple projects, rather than duplicating the library once for each.
