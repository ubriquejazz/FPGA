The Hammerhead Tools CD contains the documentation and board level libraries and 
example software for all of BittWare's Hammerhead family of products, as well as
the latest 21160 Anomaly list and VDSP patches and service packs from Analog 
Devices (to save you from having to download them from Analog Device's web site).

The docs folder contains Users Guide (pdfs) and Anomaly lists (word docs) for 
multiple versions of HH boards (form factor and revision).  Please ensure you 
are looking at the documentation specific to your board.


The naming convention for the Hammerhead family is 
	HHff, 
where ff is form factor, which are:
	PC = PCI
	6U = 6U CompactPCI
	3U = 3U CompactPCI
	PM = PMC+
	P4 = PC-104Plus

For the Users Guide, the naming convention is:
	ug-hhffnn-rr
where: 
	ug = users guide
	hh = hammerhead
	ff = form factor (PC,6U,3U,PM,P4)
	nn = board revision number
	rr = document revision number

Also included is the Users Guide for the SharcFIN 160G (ug-sfin160g-0p), which 
is found on the HH6U Rev 1, HHPM Rev 1, HHP4 Rev 1, HH3U Rev 0, and HHPC Rev 2.  
Details for the SharcFIN on the HHPC Rev 1 can be found in the board users guide 
and in the pdf document entitled "Sharcfin-pci".

The latest list of known anomalies, limitations, and restrictions for each revision
of the boards are in the Word files named:
	"HHff Anomalies Vn.nnn Ummddyy"
where:
	ff = form factor
	n.nn = board revision level
	Ummddyy = date of anomaly list update
